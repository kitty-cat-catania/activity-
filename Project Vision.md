Group Project #1

For our project, we will be analyzing available data with regards to various Covid-19 statistics. Our goal is to observe how the Sars-CoV-2 virus affected different groups throughout the United States.  Specifically, we will look at how the virus affected different age groups, genders, cultural groups, and regions.  We will also focus on qualities such as marital status, economic status, employment status, what types of jobs held, etc., and determine any correlation between them and Covid-19 infection, hospitalization, and recovery rate.
